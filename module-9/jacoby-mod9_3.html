    <h1>Assignment 9.3: Javascript - Par 1</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Aidan Jacoby.  <span class ="sentence">I am 21 years old.</span>  I will graduate in August of next year along with you all.
    My favorite football team is the San Fransisco 49ers.
    </p>
    <p>Taking these courses have been very fulfilling to me.  I feel like this <span id = "system">____</span> has allowed me to really learn a lot of information quickly.  I am excited for the future of this course!</p>
    <p>I have been a <span id="niners">____</span> fan for my entire life.  My dad grew up in sacremento, so it was pretty much <span id="ingrained">____</span> in his, and then my head to be a fan.  Despite this, I have really only bee nheavily into football for about the last five years, and its been a ride!</p>
    <p>I hope to be able to succeed more in this <span id="course">____</span>, as we look to be mostly out of the theory and more into the practical, which is where I have always shined </p>
